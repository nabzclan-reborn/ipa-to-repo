# üì¶ IPA to Repo Integration Guide

This guide will help you convert your IPA file into a ready-to-use repository and integrate it with iOS app signers like AltStore, Scarlet, or Esign and more.

## üìå Overview

The endpoint extracts necessary metadata from your IPA file and generates a repository JSON structure, which you can add to your iOS app signer of choice to make the app available for easy sideloading.

## üåê Endpoint URL

```
https://cdn.nabzclan.vip/ipa-to-repo
```

## üí≠ Test

```bash
https://cdn.nabzclan.vip/ipa-to-repo?ipa_url=https://cloud.nabzclan.vip/file/5wc/P12Cracker_(Beta)-nabzclan.vip_1.0.ipa
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Endpoint

### **Step 1: Provide Your IPA URL**

Ensure you have a direct download link to your IPA file. The URL must be publicly accessible.

### **Step 2: Make a Request**

You can use the following example to make a request to the endpoint using cURL, your browser, or any HTTP client.

#### Example Request

```text
 https://cdn.nabzclan.vip/ipa-to-repo?ipa_url=https://example.com/path/to/yourfile.ipa
```

### **Step 3: Obtain the Repository JSON**

The endpoint will return a JSON response containing your IPA's metadata formatted as a repository.

#### Example JSON Response

## üì≤ Adding to iOS App Signers

Follow the steps below to add the generated repository to popular iOS app signers.

### üîµ **Scarlet**

1. **Open Scarlet** on your iOS device.
2. Go to **Sources** and tap on the **+** icon to add a new source.
3. **Enter the `sourceURL`** from the JSON response as the URL:
   ```
   https://cdn.nabzclan.vip/ipa-to-repo?ipa_url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fyourfile.ipa
   ```
4. Tap **Add** and wait for Scarlet to fetch the repository details.
5. Once added, your app should appear under the available apps list in Scarlet.

### üü¢ **AltStore**

1. Open **AltStore** on your iOS device.
2. Navigate to the **Sources** tab and tap the **+** button.
3. Enter the `sourceURL`:
   ```
   https://cdn.nabzclan.vip/ipa-to-repo?ipa_url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fyourfile.ipa
   ```
4. Tap **Add Source** and allow AltStore to fetch the repository details.
5. The app will now be listed in AltStore, and you can sideload it directly.

### üî¥ **Esign**

4. Tap **Add** and wait for Esign to load the apps.
5. Your app should now be visible and ready for installation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Tips

- Always ensure your IPA URL is a **direct download link** (no redirects or authentication).
- Some cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) might not provide direct URLs; you may need to adjust sharing settings to generate a valid direct link.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- **Invalid URL Error**: Ensure that the `ipa_url` parameter is a valid, accessible URL.
- **Metadata Fallbacks**: If your IPA file doesn‚Äôt have all the required metadata, the system will use default values.
